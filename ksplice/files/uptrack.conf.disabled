# * protocol is the protocol to connect to the proxy (http or https)
# * the username and password are the authentication
#   information needed to use your proxy (if any).
# * host and port are the hostname/ip address and port number used to
#   connect to the proxy

# The proxy must support making HTTPS connections. If this is unset,
# Uptrack will look for the https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, and http_proxy
# environment variables in that order, and then finally look for a
# proxy setting in the system-wide GConf database, if available.
