# TODO:
# * create the directory in _part too

# This resource collects file snippets from a directory ($dir) and concatenates
# them in lexical order of their names into a new file ($name). This can be
# used to collect information from disparate sources, when the target file
# format doesn't allow includes.
#
# concatenated_file_part can be used to easily configure content for this.
#
# If no $dir is specified, the target name with '.d' appended will be used.
#
# Depend on File[$name] to change if and only if its contents change. Notify
# Exec["concat_${name}"] if you want to force an update.
# 
# Usage:
#  concatenated_file { "/etc/some.conf":
#  	dir => "/etc/some.conf.d",
#  }
# Define: concatenated_file
#
# Actions:
#	Undocumented
#
# Depends:
#	Undocumented
#	gen_puppet
