[Channel]
	# Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections.
	# Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
	# persist when there are no more members left.
	# Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
	# and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
	# There may be more than one [Channel] block, one for each channel.

	# Name of the channel
	Name = <%= name %>

	# Topic for this channel

	# Key file, syntax for each line: "<user>:<nick>:<key>".
	# Default: none.
